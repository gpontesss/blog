Most critiques of the doctrine of the Trinity are superficial, for they don't
know the reality of the doctrine. Generally they'll hear the basic doctrine
formulated as such:

1. The Father is God;
1. The Son is God;
1. The Holy Spirit is God;
1. There's only One God;
1. The Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit;
1. The Son is not the Father, nor the Holy Spirit;
1. The Holy Spirit is not the Son, nor the Father,

and they'll immediately notice that there's seems to be a contradiction: if
there's only One God, how can three persons be called "God"?

To make the simplest critique of the doctrine requires that one understands the
doctrine beyond its basics, so it is not misrepresented when making an argument
against it. It is not a simple subject, for many terms need to be qualified
before one can start to formulated an argument. Refusing to consider what is
being said only accounts for dishonesty, for there's no interest in truth,
but only in disagreement. That said, I feel these are the main subjects to be
understood:

+ [How the word "God" is used]
+ [Issues discussed in the Council of Nicea]
+ [The nature of debate]
+ [Main questions that should be asked]
+ [In what way it is a Mystery]


### How the word "God" is used

### Issues discussed in the Council of Nicea

The second thing which most will say is that

+ though other Christological debates exist, Nicea is the most important
+ ignorant of the Nicene Creed and key assertions
    + homoousios
    + eternality
    + created (notes on begotten)

### Main questions that should be asked

+ Was Christ preexistent?: this might be an often overlooked question for most,
    but "Biblical Unitarians" are a group of a considerable size. If Christ
    didn't exist before the Incarnation, then the Trinity cannot be true, since
    it states that all three Persons are Eternal, i.e., have no begginning and
    end. I believe the question is the easiest, but, nonetheless, shouldn't be
    ignored;
+ Did Christ possess the Divine nature?: this is where one the most
    misconceptions about the Trinity is made: the assertion that Christ is God
    is not one of identity with the Father --- often in the NT referred simply
    as "the God" ---, but of nature. If Christ has the Divine nature, than he
    can be called God by _predication_. Most people won't recognize this
    problem, even though it was the main issue discussed in the Council of
    Nicea;
+ Do the angels have the Divine nature?: this is the next obvious question, for
    the angels are called "sons of God", and, same times, called "gods" --- and
    it isn't limited to angels, for Satan is called "god", also. This brings a
    similar question: is Jesus a mere angel? If so, the assertion that only
    three persons have the Divine nature would be false;
+ Was Jesus Eternal/created?: I formulated the question including both terms,
    "Eternal" and "created", as interchangable, since most might see this
    question as two separate ones, but, in fact, they're not. In the definition
    used trinitarian theology, Eternal means not contigent. Something which is
    Eternal, i.e., had no beginning, cannot be created for it's necessary;
    a created thing is always contingent. Thus, if Christ is Eternal, He can't
    be created. This are the main assertions present in the Nicene Creed about
    the Divine nature, thus making them key to prove the coherence of the
    doctrine;
+ Is the Holy Spirit a Person?: though less discussed, discussing the personhood
    and divinity of the Holy Spirit is key to the doctrine. If the Holy Spirit
    is only a force, then you have a form of binitarianism, at most. Answering
    this question is often enough, since most people would agree that when the
    Holy Spirit acts, it actually is God. There are really strong statements
    about the Spirit too, e.g., that those who blaspheme He won't be forgiven,
    etc.

### In what way it is a Mystery

...

### The nature of debate

+ The main critique is of the doctrine's coherence
+ Though many might overlook it, the biblical evidence should be coherent with
    it
    + This is why Trinity models like Social Trinitarianism are invalid
+ Though history shouldn't be the rule, it makes arguments strong
    + Most second tier critiques say the doctrine was developed through the
        centuries
+ Historical facts that should be worth mentioning:
    + Pre-Christian seeds of the doctrine
    + Evidence on first Christians thought
    + Anachronisms often come up: important to know how people defined things at
        the time of discussion.

+ Assertions that shouldn't be taken seriously:
    + blaming of constantine
    + pagan origins


### Resources for further investigation

+ note that most sources are Orthodox for they are the only one who are in
    completely line with the ecumenical councils
+ subjects:
    + philosophical arguments: beau branson and jay dyer
    + teophanies: stephen de young is a good resource
    + seraphim hamilton on biblical theology
