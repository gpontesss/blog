There's a common thing that happens when someone is struck by a genius idea: one
proceeds to try to apply it to everything, as if he had found a hammer and,
suddenly, all things look like nails. For most ideas, that doesn't go too far,
and its limitations, exceptions etc., are soon revealed, and the idea settles in
its final form and lives in its own world that is demarcated by the limits
found: it turns out that not everything is a nail, and, even if it is true,
there are types of nails that should not be hammered, but applied with air
pressure etc.

The quest of metaphysics is to find the right hammer that can make everything a
nail, without exceptions. It should be so complete that the hammer itself could
also be a nail! Believe it or not, that's not so absurd as it sounds, and the
traditions of the world have long before us found this hammer. (Which is also a
nail.) In our decaying perception of reality, though, it has been lost to our
common knowledge in Western society... I want to try to present it not only in a
theoretical way, as it is most of the time presented to us and lost due to its
dullness, but in an almost experiential way.
