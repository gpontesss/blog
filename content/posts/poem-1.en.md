<div style="text-align: center">
"The fire", you ask me,<br>
"What does it mean?"<br>

A floating movement<br>
Which soothes the eyes.<br>
Delicate in its wavering;<br>
Hypnotizing shining light.<br>

Amidst the deep darkness<br>
Leads one into captivity.<br>
As attached to a harness<br>
Even dragged to profanity.<br>

And, thus, lies the mystery,<br>
The dycothomy of the element:<br>
The same uncovers Beauty<br>
And burns with its temperament.<br>

The wise man properly asks:<br>
"Who can tame its power;<br>
By it not be devoured?"<br>
And this he's yet to grasp.<br>

Only one discerment is made:<br>
Fire exists in various shapes.<br>
And this no man mistakes:<br>
Its perennial form is a maid.<br>
</div>
