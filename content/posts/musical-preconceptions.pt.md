Did you ever listen to a song and felt there was something off about it? Maybe
it had an odd tempo and an hypnotizing percussion line, but it wasn't pleasant.
Or maybe it didn't have a clear line of progression, was really strident and did
not cause any joy to you; rather it was real noise. Or yet it had a massive
atmosphere and put in a state of horror for its tenebrous mood.

I quote these cases for I have either experienced or presenced them in my life.
It always get me to think: what it is about it that make someone not enjoy it?
And, for what I've seen, it seems to always boil down to culture. What does it
mean?

Imagine your average millenial. What is "all the rage" nowadays? I'm not
actually sure, but would guess some male pop singer for the girls, and maybe
a rapper for some guys. I do have in mind that exists a wide variety of styles
according to groups. Some like K-Pop, others Rock from the 80's, yet others the
latest Pop hit, still others will listen to whatever is on the radio, and the
list goes on. And, to be fair, the difference is not important to the point. So
just take every style that feels youthful and call it.

Am I not making a point of clash of culture? Don't all the above cited styles
belong to different groups with distinct cultures? How am I able to generilize
them? The point is that they all fit into a bucket that could be classified as
"western music", even K-Pop. Yes, they all have their little quirks that
identify them. But, see, most of the music produced by them were made to sell a
lot, which means they appeal to the masses. You don't take risks with something
that may sound off to them! How do you expect to sell anything, then? It may not
be obvious to the untrained years, but they're structure is extremely similar
harmonically and rythmically.

That is not to say, in any way, that everyone likes all them and don't have
clashes inside of mainstream groups. Some Rock listeners don't hate Pop, and the
circle goes on with all sorts of styles. Thus, my opinion is, their differences
are represented simply by a common sense opinion, often influenced by others
from inside the group, other than real spook provoked by a certain style. You
see, when I said "something off" at the start I meant an unexpected clash, as
something totally alien.

I will tell a little anecdote to illustrate it. My mother currently works as an
infant teacher. At their school there's a custom of letting the kids take a nap
at some point of the day. To stimulate their relaxation she often puts calming
music for them to listen. She's lazy to create a spotify account for herself and
uses mine. Sometimes at work I'll be listening to something and have it paused,
when she starts to  play something at her phone. I always ask her to create her
own account, but she never did it. So I did a little experiment with her.

I'm able to control what plays in what device. Then, me, with that riddle about
people's musical preconceptions, chooses one that I have had some trouble
myself. There goes I, put in the listening queue "Miserere Mei Deus"[^1]. You
may want to listen to it. So the music starts to play and after around 30
seconds in she stops playing it. She doesn't choose another song for that day.
It seems that I'm free to continue to listen to whatever I want for the rest of
the afternoon. What happened at the other side?
