Chinese Cosmology's symbols and its Medicine reveal a profound connection
between the nature of breath and the way to dettachment.

## Chinese Cosmology and the organs of the body

In Traditional Chinese Medicine there are five main organs which are associated
with the five movements[^1], part of their metaphysics. These are, in their
creative order: water, associated with the kidneys; wood, with the liver; fire,
with the heart; earth, with the stomach; metal, with the lungs.[^2] 
For each movement, there are images that helps one to understand the qualities
of an organ and its association with the others. Such qualities span across a
variety of senses. For the lungs --- what matters for this discussion, for they
relate to breath ---, the Metal element is associated with the autumn season,
the color white, with the skins and hair, and with the emotions of sadness and
grief. Metal is also the "Heaven" trigram (☰) in the I Ching, which is
associated with the pure Yang energy, and its Hexagram (䷀) is called "Creative".

All of these symbols related to Metal have some relation to dettachment, but
we'll focus on the Lungs, its relationship to breath, and its characteristic
feelings. It's important to understand that the Mind and Body in Chinese
Cosmology are one holistic whole. Thus, what happens in one's Mind is reflected
in the functioning of one's body, and vice-versa.


## Lungs and breath

The Lungs are related to our breath. In Chinese Medicine, it spans to other
areas of the body, since everything is connected. As it is said in the _Huangdi
Neijing_[^3], "it communicates with the throat, and opens into the nose", which
are the ways one uses to breath.

Breath is the constant movement of air. In truth, everything that is alive and
working properly should be in movement, for stagnation is the sign of disease
and death. In this, we see the ultimate sign of dettachment in the lungs, for
air is that which we never even think about. Our breathing is constant, yet
transparent and automatic. There you bear the physical sign of emptiness, which
is associated with true dettachment, where you "work" without any conscience of
your work; breath the air, essential to your vitality, without realizing it, or
wanting to keep it, for, if you try to, you'll die shortly.

## Lungs, sadness and grief

As said, the Lungs, in Chinese Medicine, are related to the feelings of sadness
and grief.

Though not as easy to define as grief, sadness has to do with attachment when it
is related to loss -- which is the case of grief -- and the resistance to
change. We feel sad when we have a hard time accepting our situation because we
hoped it could be otherwise, usually better. It also may come out of
disappointment, which has to do with unmet expectations. In these cases, there's
the sense of attachment in all cases, with wished situations, unwillingness to
accept the current reality and the will of it to be different, like the images
we created in our head, which are not real.

We can see the reflection of sadness and grief in our breath. Someone who's sad
--- attached to some image or thought --- has a shallow breath, tending to stop;
there's a tendency to stagnation. All systems are connected, and what happens in
the mind is reflected in one's body and behavior. Thus, the difficulty of
letting thoughts and things go is reflected in our breath; in a difficulty of
cycling the air through the lungs, not letting things come and go naturally.

## Breath and meditation

Daoist meditation is the practice of emptying oneself. This process can involve
breath, in a continuous dettachment of everything that is not consciousness,
then, towards the Void, which is beyond conscience. Though it's one of the first
steps, the practice of transferring your conscience to your breath shows how
it's a step towards the achievement of total dettachment. That's why some many
practices across the cultures involve breath in their spiritual exercises of
transcending themselves, which is, in essence, the abdication of one's Self.[^4]

In the breathwork involved with meditation, there's an alchemical use, where the
constant attention to breathing --- mainly a physical activity ---  produces a
change in one's psyche. Through transferring your conscience to breath, and,
thus, "becoming the flowing air", there you are able to let go of things. Some
people describe it by saying that through breathing exercise's one is able to
expel thoughts, emotions, and every other calcified object in one's psyche that
holds them back from flowing naturally. Notice, then, the connection, once
again, with attachment: that which is stuck in us is put in movement through
breath.

## Concentration as the transformative cause

It's worth noting that simply breathing can't change anyone's psyche naturally.
If so, no one alive could ever have attachment issues. Yet, the contemplation of
the nature of breath and its meaning is what can be the transformative cause of
one's psyche. Meditation is concentration, which is a conscious act, and not
unconscious, requiring one to "work" with the Mind.

This shows that the nature of air and our breath reveal to us a profound truth
about life and its nature. But, being a revelation, it is perceived through our
Mind and Conscience. Thus, breathing is a _symbol_ of dettachment, but _not the
way_ of achieving it, _per se_. In this kind of practice, it is always stressed
that there's a work of concentration and attention in the breathing itself, and
that it can never work if one lets the mind wondering through random thoughts.

Thus, be mindful of your breathing, and, then, you might acquire its nature and
become able to flow naturally through life, without being attached to things
that drag you behind.

[^1]: The five movements are built on top the the phases o Yin and Yang, and
    show certain cyclical qualities that are inherited by everything. They are a
    building block of every Daoist art.
[^2]: These are the Yin organs associated with the movements. There are also
    Yang organs that correspond to each of the movements, but they don't matter
    for the discussion, for the Yin organs are the ones closer to one's psyche,
    while Yang organs are closer to one's physical body.
[^3]: _Huangdi Neijing_ means "Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor", an ancient
    Chinese medical text which is the basis of much of Traditional Chinese
    Medicine's practice.
[^4]: Breathwork is present in Hindu culture, as one of the first steps one
    should take towards the goal of Meditation when practicing Yoga; in the
    Eastern Christian culture, the unceasing practice of the Prayer of the Heart
    is synchronized with one's breath, as instructed in the Philokalia, a
    collection of writtings from various saints who practiced Hesychasm. (Which
    means "inner silence".)
    Just to notice, I'm not implying all of these practices aim to attain the
    some final goal. What's said is that they all use breathwork to achieve
    dettachness in some way, but each of these spiritual practices involve
    much more than that, specifically.
