<div style="text-align: center">
The Light has caught my eye<br>
Revealed fine paths, so high<br>
Impaled me at first sight<br>
Blinded me with its bright<br>

Even infused in my dreams<br>
Did stir entire thoughts<br>
To unveil what I could not:<br>
The union of seen and unseen<br>

Its shining is grace-filled<br>
Attracts all those around<br>
But fooled was I in the crowd<br>
Knowing not it was owned<br>

That's the very end<br>
Of all who pretend<br>
One can stare at Light<br>
Without losing sight<br>
</div>
