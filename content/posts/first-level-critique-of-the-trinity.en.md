Most critiques of the doctrine of the Trinity are superficial, for they don't
know the reality of the doctrine. Generally they'll hear the basic doctrine
formulated as such:

1. The Father is God;
1. The Son is God;
1. The Holy Spirit is God;
1. There's only One God;
1. The Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit;
1. The Son is not the Father, nor the Holy Spirit;
1. The Holy Spirit is not the Son, nor the Father,

and they'll immediately notice that there seems to be a contradiction: if
there's only One God, how can three persons be called "God" and,  yet, be
distinct individuals?

To make the simplest critique of the doctrine requires that one understands the
doctrine beyond its basics, so it is not misrepresented when making an argument
against it. It is not a simple subject, for many terms need to be qualified
before one can start to formulated an argument. Refusing to consider what is
being said only accounts for dishonesty, for there's no interest in truth,
but only in disagreement. That said, I feel these are the main subjects to be
understood:

+ [How the word "God" is used]()
+ [Issues discussed in the Council of Nicea]()
+ [The nature of debate]()
+ [Main questions that should be asked]()
+ [In what way it is a Mystery]()


### How the word "God" is used

Many try to argue that the word "God" is a exclusive name to the Father. If it
is, then John 20:28 should be identified Christ as the Father, which is
nonsensical taking the rest of the Gospel into consideration: Christ is clearly
distinct from the Father. Trinitarian theology knows it well, and that's why
that is why it can't agree that "God" always identifies the Father.  If so, you
would fall into Modalism (Also known as Sabellianism), which is a clear heresy
condemned by the Church as early as the 3rd century.

In the original Greek there are some nuances that I'm not fully capable of
explaining, but the basic idea is that the NT uses two forms when your
translation renders the word "God": <span class="greek">"ὁ θεός"</span>, (e.g.,
used in John 20:28.) which literally "the God", since it contains the definite
article, and <span class="greek">"θεὸς"</span>, (e.g., used in John 1:1.) which
could be analagous to the english form "a god", though Greek only has definite
articles. It could also be translated just as "god", to identify it lacks the
definite article. (Some translations do this. Check David Bentley Hart's NT
translation.[^1]) It can also be used as a form of predication, to mean
something as vague as "divine".

Thus, it's clear that it's not so simple to affirm that everytime your Bible
renders the word "God" it's referencing the Father. When doing any kind of
exegesis, noting these subtle differences is key to understand orthodox
trinitarian theology. Otherwise, without the required nuance, the result is,
indeed, a contradiction. If the doctrine was ignorant of it, the
Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed --- the fundamental creed recited by every
believer, which, among other things, states the divinity of the three Persons
--- wouldn't be able to say: "We believe in _one God, the Father Almighty_ [...]
And in one Lord Jesus Christ [...] _very God of very God_ [...] And in the Holy
Ghost [...] who _with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and
glorified_". Trinitarian theology's main goal is to harmonize these nuances into
a coherent formulation of the nature and unity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit.


### Issues discussed in the Council of Nicea

The second thing which most will say is that

+ though other Christological debates exist, Nicea is the most important
+ ignorant of the Nicene Creed and key assertions
    + homoousios
    + eternality
    + created (notes on begotten)

### Main questions that should be asked

Though not limited to, I feel these are the main questions that should be
considered when discussing the doctrine of the Trinity:

+ **Was Christ preexistent?:** this might be an often overlooked question for
    most, but "Biblical Unitarians" are a group of a considerable size. If
    Christ didn't exist before the Incarnation, then the Trinity cannot be true,
    since it states that all three Persons are Eternal, i.e., have no begginning
    and end. I believe the question is the easiest, but, nonetheless, shouldn't
    be ignored;
+ **Did Christ possess the Divine nature?:** this is where one the greatest
    misconceptions about the Trinity is made: the assertion that Christ is God
    is not one of identity with the Father --- often in the NT referred simply
    as "the God" ---, but of nature. If Christ has the Divine nature, then he
    can be called God by _predication_. Most people won't recognize this
    problem, even though it was the main issue discussed in the Council of
    Nicea. The overlook of this question is the reason why John of Damascus said
    that all heresies arise from a confusion between nature and person;
+ **Do angels possess the Divine nature?:** this is the next obvious question,
    for the angels are called "sons of God", and, some times, called "gods" ---
    also, it isn't limited to angels, for Satan is called "god", also. This
    brings a similar question: is Jesus a mere angel? If so, the assertion that
    only three persons have the Divine nature would be false;
+ **Was Jesus eternal/created?:** I formulated the question including both terms,
    "eternal" and "created", as interchangable, since most might see this
    question as two separate ones, but, in fact, they're not. In the definition
    used trinitarian theology, eternal means not contigent, i.e., necessary.
    Something which is eternal, i.e., had no beginning, cannot be created for
    it's necessary; a created thing is always contingent. Thus, if Christ is
    eternal, He can't be created. These are the main assertions present in the
    Nicene Creed about the Divine nature, thus making them key to prove the
    coherence of the doctrine;
+ **Is it being "_a se_" predicated by the Divine nature?**: "_a se_" is a latin
    expression which means "from itself" and indicates that a being has no
    cause. It's clear that the Son and Holy Spirit have are cause by the
    Father: it is stated in the Creed that the Son is "begotten of the Father",
    and the Holy Spirit "proceeds from the Father". Thus, the Father is the only
    "uncaused cause", or --- as the Church Fathers say --- the "mono arche",
    which means "the one source". The problem is of the philosophical nature,
    but simple to understand: if to have the Divine nature it is needed to be
    "from itself", how can the Son and Holy Spirit, beings caused by the Father,
    be Divine?;
+ **Is the Holy Spirit a person?:** though less discussed, discussing the
    personhood and divinity of the Holy Spirit is key to the doctrine. If the
    Holy Spirit is only a force, then you have a form of binitarianism, at most.
    Answering this question is often enough, since most people would agree that
    when the Holy Spirit acts, it actually is God. There are really strong
    statements about the Spirit too, e.g., that those who blaspheme He won't be
    forgiven, etc.

### In what way it is a Mystery

In philosophical  debates, to argue that a position is a "mystery" is begging
the question: you need to defend exactly how your position is coherent and
corresponds to reality. Of course, when arguing about metaphysics, some
concessions can be made, since the questions are foundational. Still, that
doesn't mean that when your conclusion contradicts your premises you can resort
to "mystery".

The Church Fathers never assumed that _nothing_ can be said about the Trinity.
In reality, they formulated the causal relationship between the Persons, stated
that all three Preson have the Divine nature and that it makes all of them
necessary Beings. They said that the Three are united in Will, Eternal and
Almighty. They distinguish each Person by their hypostatic properties, (i.e.,
individual attributes that makes each Person unique and different from the other
two.) which is key to affirm the multiplicity of Persons. They also talk about
Christ's human nature, and how it does not make Him not Divine.

In truth, much is affirmed to call it pure "mystery". Yet, sometimes some
questions are not really able to be explained, such as: How can three persons
have the same will? How can they all perform the same act? etc. These are not
explained in its details, but assumed to be something special to the Divine
nature, and, thus, not able to be fully comprehended by humans. Nonetheless, the
important note is that it should never be incoherent, but only refuse to
explain questions beyond what is humanly capable.


### The nature of debate

What has to be understood is that, first and foremost the doctrine is concerned
with the special revelation contained in the Bible. All statements should be
backed by Holy Scriptures, and not by personal preference.

+ The main critique is of the doctrine's coherence
+ Though many might overlook it, the biblical evidence should be coherent with
    it
    + This is why Trinity models like Social Trinitarianism are invalid
+ Though history shouldn't be the rule, it makes arguments strong
    + Most second tier critiques say the doctrine was developed through the
        centuries
+ Historical facts that should be worth mentioning:
    + Pre-Christian seeds of the doctrine
    + Evidence on first Christians thought
    + Anachronisms often come up: important to know how people defined things at
        the time of discussion.
+ Assertions that shouldn't be taken seriously:
    + blaming of constantine
    + pagan origins

---

Arguing that the Trinity has pagan origins is also not a good argument for two
reasons: 1) to argue that something is not true for it has a certain origin is
known as a "genetic fallacy", which states that something's origin has no
bearing on weather it is true or not; 2) people assume the religion of the jews
was totally different of the ones practiced by the sorrounding pagan nations,
when, in reality, it had much more similarities than most would like to admit.
Some of Psalms and other passages are also a direct response to stories about
the by the gods of Israel's neighbors.[^3] Generally, they state why Yahweh, the
Most High God, is Sovereign over all other gods, which assumes that some of the
metaphysics is shared between the pagan religions and the religion believed and
practiced by the jews of that time. That is not to say that everything that is
said should be equal, but the overlapping is obvious. The most known example is
the narrative of the Flood, which is present in a lot of ancient cultures. Even
Plato talks about it! Of course, that's not to say that it requires no previous
precedent for the doctrine in the OT and earlier periods before Christianity,
but it should be recognized that it shouldn't be the strongest argument
available.


## Resources for further investigation

I only exposed the questions at stake superficially. Though it might seem a lot,
there's much more to be explored about the subject, after all, it's been 15
centuries since the first controversy which formally formulated the essence of
the doctrine. These are some of the resources I've used to understand the
doctrine and its nuances:[^2]

[^1]: It's a plus that he's Orthodox, since the goal of the article is to expose
  the historical doctrine of the Trinity. Though I ackowledge that the
  translation has received some criticism, it serves only to exemplify that
  trinitarians are aware of the different uses of the word.
[^2]: Note that most sources are Orthodox for it is the only Church which
  adheres completely to the first seven ecumenical councils.
