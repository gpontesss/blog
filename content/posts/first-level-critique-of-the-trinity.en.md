Most critiques of the doctrine of the Trinity are superficial, for they don't
know the reality of the doctrine. Generally they'll hear the basic doctrine
formulated as such:

1. The Father is God;
1. The Son is God;
1. The Holy Spirit is God;
1. There's only One God;
1. The Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit;
1. The Son is not the Father, nor the Holy Spirit;
1. The Holy Spirit is not the Son, nor the Father,

and they'll immediately notice that there seems to be a contradiction: if
there's only One God, how can three persons be called "God" and,  yet, be
distinct individuals?

To make the simplest critique of the doctrine requires that one understands the
doctrine beyond its basics, so it is not misrepresented when making an argument
against it. It is not a simple subject, for many terms need to be qualified
before one can start to formulated an argument. Refusing to consider what is
being said only accounts for dishonesty, for there's no interest in truth,
but only in disagreement. That said, I feel these are the main subjects to be
understood:

+ How the word "God" is used;
+ Issues discussed in the Council of Nicea;
+ The nature of debate;
+ Main questions that should be asked;
+ In what way it is a Mystery.


### How the word "God" is used

Many try to argue that the word "God" is a exclusive name to the Father. If it
is, then John 20:28 should be identified Christ as the Father, which is
nonsensical taking the rest of the Gospel into consideration: Christ is clearly
distinct from the Father. Trinitarian theology knows it well, and that's why
that is why it can't agree that "God" always identifies the Father.  If so, you
would fall into Modalism (Also known as Sabellianism), which is a clear heresy
condemned by the Church as early as the 3rd century.

In the original Greek there are some nuances that I'm not fully capable of
explaining, but the basic idea is that the NT uses two forms when your
translation renders the word "God": <span class="greek">"ὁ θεός"</span>, (e.g.,
used in John 20:28.) which literally "the God", since it contains the definite
article, and <span class="greek">"θεὸς"</span>, (e.g., used in John 1:1.) which
could be analagous to the english form "a god", though Greek only has definite
articles. It could also be translated just as "god", to identify it lacks the
definite article. (Some translations do this. Check David Bentley Hart's NT
translation.[^1]) It can also be used as a form of predication, to mean
something as vague as "divine".

Thus, it's clear that it's not so simple to affirm that everytime your Bible
renders the word "God" it's referencing the Father. When doing any kind of
exegesis, noting these subtle differences is key to understand orthodox
trinitarian theology. Otherwise, without the required nuance, the result is,
indeed, a contradiction. If the doctrine was ignorant of it, the
Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed --- the fundamental creed recited by every
believer, which, among other things, states the divinity of the three Persons
--- wouldn't be able to say: "We believe in _one God, the Father Almighty_ [...]
And in one Lord Jesus Christ [...] _very God of very God_ [...] And in the Holy
Ghost [...] who _with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and
glorified_". Trinitarian theology's main goal is to harmonize these nuances into
a coherent formulation of the nature and unity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit.


### Issues discussed in the Council of Nicea

The Council of Nicea happened in response to the Arian controversy. Arius, a
presbyter of Alexandria, thought that Christ was the first and greatest creation
of the Father. The Council gathered bishops from all places to settle the
question about Christ's nature.

The Nicene Creed, which was formulated as the result of the Council, states:

> We belive [...] in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the
> Father, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made,
> consubstantial with the Father

Notice that it states that Christ is "begotten of the Father", which clearly
identifies that they are separate persons, something that some don't seem to
understand. As said, the very issue was about Christ's nature: had He the _same_
nature as the Father? (i.e., <span class="greek">"ὁμοούσιον"</span>.) Or was He
--- as the Arians said --- of a _similar_ nature? (i.e., (i.e., <span
class="greek">"ὁμοιούσιος"</span>.)) It's an interesting fact to note that
Arians didn't have any issues on calling Christ God and worshiping Him. Their
issue was with saying that Christ was Divine as the Father is. Thus, to condemn
the Arians, the following clauses were included in the Nicene Creed:

> But those who say: 'There was a time when he [the Son] was not'; and 'He was
> not before he was made'; and 'He was made out of nothing', or 'He is of
> another substance' or 'essence', or 'The Son of God is created', or
> 'changeable', or 'alterable' --- they are condemned by the holy catholic and
> apostolic Church.

It makes the main points of discussion clear: Arians believed that Christ was
"created", "made" and "of another substance" than that of the Father, while the
pro-Nicene belived that Christ was eternal, begotten of the Father and of the
consubstancial with Him.

Another interesting fact is that the Nicene Creed says that Christ is "begotten"
of the Father. Some try to use John 1:14 to say that Jesus was _created_ when,
in fact, it says "only-begotten", which is not problem for trinitarians. A
distinction is made by trinitarians: "begotten" only means that Christ is
originated from the Father, i.e., He is "_ab alio_", which means "from another",
while the Father is the only "_a se_" being, i.e., the only "originated from
itself". For them, to say Christ was "created" means that Christ wasn't a
necessary being. It is assumed that the Divine nature requires a being to be
necessary. Thus, if Christ had the Divine nature, in no way He could be a
creature. This is an important distinction to be made, since most don't
understand the difference between having an origin and being created.

### Main questions that should be asked

Though not limited to, I feel these are the main questions that should be
considered when discussing the doctrine of the Trinity:

+ **Was Christ preexistent?:** this might be an often overlooked question for
    most, but "Biblical Unitarians" are a group of a considerable size. If
    Christ didn't exist before the Incarnation, then the Trinity cannot be true,
    since it states that all three Persons are Eternal, i.e., have no begginning
    and end. I believe the question is the easiest, but, nonetheless, shouldn't
    be ignored;
+ **Did Christ possess the Divine nature?:** this is where one the greatest
    misconceptions about the Trinity is made: the assertion that Christ is God
    is not one of identity with the Father --- often in the NT referred simply
    as "the God" ---, but of nature. If Christ has the Divine nature, then he
    can be called God by _predication_. Most people won't recognize this
    problem, even though it was the main issue discussed in the Council of
    Nicea. The overlook of this question is the reason why John of Damascus said
    that all heresies arise from a confusion between nature and person;
+ **Do angels possess the Divine nature?:** this is the next obvious question,
    for the angels are called "sons of God", and, some times, called "gods" ---
    also, it isn't limited to angels, for Satan is called "god", also. This
    brings a similar question: is Jesus a mere angel? If so, the assertion that
    only three persons have the Divine nature would be false;
+ **Was Jesus eternal/created?:** I formulated the question including both terms,
    "eternal" and "created", as interchangable, since most might see this
    question as two separate ones, but, in fact, they're not. In the definition
    used trinitarian theology, eternal means not contigent, i.e., necessary.
    Something which is eternal, i.e., had no beginning, cannot be created for
    it's necessary; a created thing is always contingent. Thus, if Christ is
    eternal, He can't be created. These are the main assertions present in the
    Nicene Creed about the Divine nature, thus making them key to prove the
    coherence of the doctrine;
+ **Is it being "_a se_" predicated by the Divine nature?**: "_a se_" is a latin
    expression which means "from itself" and indicates that a being has no
    cause. It's clear that the Son and Holy Spirit have are cause by the
    Father: it is stated in the Creed that the Son is "begotten of the Father",
    and the Holy Spirit "proceeds from the Father". Thus, the Father is the only
    "uncaused cause", or --- as the Church Fathers say --- the "mono arche",
    which means "the one source". The problem is of the philosophical nature,
    but simple to understand: if to have the Divine nature it is needed to be
    "from itself", how can the Son and Holy Spirit, beings caused by the Father,
    be Divine?;
+ **Is the Holy Spirit a person?:** though less discussed, discussing the
    personhood and divinity of the Holy Spirit is key to the doctrine. If the
    Holy Spirit is only a force, then you have a form of binitarianism, at most.
    Answering this question is often enough, since most people would agree that
    when the Holy Spirit acts, it actually is God. There are really strong
    statements about the Spirit too, e.g., that those who blaspheme He won't be
    forgiven, etc.

### In what way it is a Mystery

In philosophical  debates, to argue that a position is a "mystery" is begging
the question: you need to defend exactly how your position is coherent and
corresponds to reality. Of course, when arguing about metaphysics, some
concessions can be made, since the questions are foundational. Still, that
doesn't mean that when your conclusion contradicts your premises you can resort
to "mystery".

The Church Fathers never assumed that _nothing_ can be said about the Trinity.
In reality, they formulated the causal relationship between the Persons, stated
that all three Preson have the Divine nature and that it makes all of them
necessary Beings. They said that the Three are united in Will, Eternal and
Almighty. They distinguish each Person by their hypostatic properties, (i.e.,
individual attributes that makes each Person unique and different from the other
two.) which is key to affirm the multiplicity of Persons. They also talk about
Christ's human nature, and how it does not make Him not Divine.

In truth, much is affirmed to call it pure "mystery". Yet, sometimes some
questions are not really able to be explained, such as: How can three persons
have the same will? How can they all perform the same act? etc. These are not
explained in its details, but assumed to be something special to the Divine
nature, and, thus, not able to be fully comprehended by humans. Nonetheless, the
important note is that it should never be incoherent, but only refuse to
explain questions beyond what is humanly capable.


### The nature of debate

I think there are three important points that should be touched in a debate
about the Trinity:

1. The evidence in the Holy Scriptures;
1. The coherence of statements made;
1. The historical background.

First and foremost the doctrine is concerned with the special revelation
contained in the Bible. This is an important detail to be observed for those who
are looking for proving the faith as a whole. This might be overlooked by some
for, you may have a coherent model that describes the Trinity, but it is not
supported by Scriptures. (e.g., what I'd happens with Social Trinitarianism.)
All statements should be backed by Holy Scriptures, and not by personal
preference.

Where Scripture is not clear and interpretations can go either way, generally
that's where philosophy comes in, for the main critique is about the doctrine's
coherence. Thus, discussion on metaphysical concepts often become the focus of
debate. When this is the case, I feel it's important to know two things that
bear no weight in the truth value of the doctrine: 1) Its argued origin; 2) The
moral status of people who formulated it.

I'm trying to state the obvious, though these points might be missed by some: in
a debate, the focus should be on formulating arguments to demonstrate why a
position is coherent (in the case of the defense.) or incoherent. (in the case
of the critique.) To argue that the Trinity has pagan origins is not a good
argument for two reasons:

1. To argue that something is not true for it has a certain origin is known as a
   "genetic fallacy". The origin of a thing has no bearing on weather it is true
   or not;
1. People assume the religion of the jews was totally different of the ones
   practiced by the sorrounding pagan nations, when, in reality, it had much
   more similarities than most would like to admit. Some of Psalms and other
   passages are also a direct response to stories about the gods of Israel's
   neighbors.[^2] Generally, they state why Yahweh, the Most High God, is
   Sovereign over all other gods, which assumes that some of the metaphysics is
   shared between the pagan religions and the religion believed and practiced by
   the jews of that time. That is not to say that everything that is said should
   be equal, but the overlapping is obvious. The most known example is the
   narrative of the Flood, which is present in a lot of ancient cultures. Even
   Plato talks about it! Of course, that's not to say that it requires no
   previous precedent for the doctrine in the OT and earlier periods before
   Christianity, but it should be recognized that it shouldn't be the strongest
   argument available.[^3]

To argue against the doctrine, stating that people who formulated it were
morally questionable is known as an "ad hominem" attack, which tries to diminish
their credibility, though it shouldn't imply anything about the truth that they
defend.

Another point that should be noted is that anachronisms shouldn't be valid
critiques, and attention must be paid to not commit this kind of mistake. To
redefine old terms to carry comtemporary meanings is a misrepresentation of a
position. Arguments should always care to use terms in their context, with their
attributed meaning. This is important, for, sometimes, Church Fathers altered
the meaning of common used terms to mean specific concepts.

The last topic is history. Much is argued that the doctrine was developed in the
4th century, and there was no precedent of it, neither in the pre-Christian
period, which includes the OT period and the intertestamental period known as
the "Second Temple period", nor in the first Christians' writtings, including
those of the NT and those among the Apostolic Fathers. The subject is wide, and
there's a lot of material to be considered in this area. Yet, it should be
said that historical evidence is not necessarily proof of truth on the matter,
since it's always possible to quote "heretics" etc. Nevertheless, it's strengh
is in showing that the doctrine was not an inovation, but was always present in
essence before it was formally stated.


## Resources for further investigation

I only exposed the questions at stake superficially. Though it might seem a lot,
there's much more to be explored about the subject --- after all, it's been more
than 15 centuries since the first controversy which formally formulated the
essence of the doctrine. These are some of the resources I've used to understand
the doctrine and its nuances:[^4]

[^1]: It's a plus that he's Orthodox, since the goal of the article is to expose
  the historical doctrine of the Trinity. Though I ackowledge that the
  translation has received some criticism, it serves only to exemplify that
  trinitarians are aware of the different uses of the word.
[^4]: Note that most sources are Orthodox for it is the only Church which
  adheres completely to the first seven ecumenical councils.
[^2]: Psalms 24 is an example, where there's a response to the "Baal Cycle",
  where it was said that he was the went to Sheol to go up against the gods Yam
  and Nahar. The Psalm states that, even though Baal goes to the "heart of the
  Earth", the entire Earth, and everything in it, belongs to the Most High God,
  Yahweh. In the end it becomes even clearer that it's directed to Baal, for the
  gates of Sheol are mentioned. This is also a reference to Christ's descent to
  Hades --- the equivalent word for Sheol in Greek --- which is commented in the
  NT. Baal is seen as Satan in the Bible, which is defeated by Christ after His
  sacrifice. The Cycle tells an inverted story where Baal conquers the
  underworld. This kind of inversion in relation with the Bible is what often
  happens in the pagan versions of these stories. Psalm 82 is another example,
  where the so-called "gods" are judged in the Divine Council by the Word of
  Yahweh, which is Christ. These "gods" are the angels appointed to take care of
  the nations in Deut. 32:8. They rebelled and went to pursue worship for
  themselves. That's why they're judged and comdemned. There are other examples,
  but these serve to show how the Bible itself ackowledges the existence of the
  pagan gods and shares some of the metaphysics with their religion. (For more
  information on these topics, I'd recommend Stephen De Young's book "Religion
  of the Apostles" and the podcast "Lord of Spirits", of which he is a cohost.)
[^3]: There are also interesting parallels between the worship in the OT and in
  the pagan nations. Dr. Benjamin Sommer, a jew who has published things that
  suggest the idea of a triune God is contained in the OT, has commented about
  these simmilarities in the [episode "Does God Have a Body?" of the podcast
  "The Bible for Normal People"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aFnRpNQFhI).
