Hello! My name is Guilherme Pontes, and this is my blog. Here I gather a great
share of my projects and thoughts. I have lots of interests, and they are
scattered in the content. The lateral bar contains the main pages. There goes a
brief description of them:

* **[all](/en/)**: List of all the articles I wrote;
* **[library](/en/library/)**: List of all (or almost all) the books I own;
* **[about](/en/about/)**: Presentation of the blog and personal information.

If you want to find me in other places or contact me:

* **github**: [@gpontesss](https://github.com/gpontesss);
* **email**: [{{< param "email" >}}](mailto:{{< param "email" >}}).
