<p> The blog's title is inspired in the excerpt above. The intent is to dispose
my thoughts and reflections along "life's journey". As in Lewis' story, I
believe there is a final destiny to all. Which will be the end of each one? Only
time will tell, inevitably...  </p>

<p> Anyhow, what is intended here are my interests, and these are among the most
varied: from theology to culinary; from literature to music; from philosophy to
programming; etc. Life from every angle along the journey is what I seek. As
Sertillanges said: insert the phrase.  </p>
