I'm still reading it. But I may want to go through it writing my impressions.

## A note on evolution

From the first chapter I can see that Jordan is going to use evolutionary
examples throughtout the whole book. This is not a surprise for he also uses
them extensibly at his online lectures. This is not something that I have a
problem with, but I think is worth stating my view point at the subject.

I have a big problem with what people nowadays call "evolution theory". It
states that all species came from a simple organism, which, in turn, came from
inorganic matter. All beings, it states, were developed from mutations and the
stronger of these survived through a phenomenon called "natural selection".

The rest doesn't really matter, for my problem is within its premises.
